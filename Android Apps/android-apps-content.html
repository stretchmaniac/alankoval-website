    <h1>Android Apps</h1>
    Yep, I've done some Android. Two applications, to be precise.

    ADKalc Widget is a simple widget designed to display a varying message 
    on an Android phone via the home screen. If you ever wanted to compute a 
    formula based on the day, your battery life or the month, ADKalc Widget 
    allows you to do so. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For example, if you wanted to know the floor of your battery level multiplied by a random 
    number between zero and one and added to pi,  you could enter:
    <br>
    <div class='different'>"My number is... " floor( battery_level * random() + pi )</div>
    <br>
    <div class='shortline'></div>
    <br>
    This was my first experience with <i>parsing</i>, that is, converting input in the form 
    of an equation to something a computer can evaluate. 
    <br>
    <br>
    You can also change the text color and background color of your widget with my home-spun 
    color picker:
    <br>
    <img style='max-width:calc(100% - 40px);margin-right:auto;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;display:block;margin-left:auto;' 
        src='http://alankoval.com/img/widget-color-picker-screenshot.png'>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style='font-size:30px'>2. 
        <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.java.wallpapers.bouncingbubble'>Bouncing Bubbles Live Wallpaper</a>
    </span>
    <img style='max-width:calc(100% - 40px);margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px' src='http://alankoval.com/img/bubble-screenshot.png'>
    Bouncing Bubbles is a (free) live wallpaper for the android home screen. Instead of a picture as the background, 
    this app makes a moving, organic and slightly distracting arrangement of colorful circles that bounce among themselves. 
    <br>

    This was the first Android App I made. It was also the first openly available sample of my work. 
    It's a little corny, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out. 
    <br>

    You can change an array of settings, including the bubble colors, the speed of the bubbles, and whether you 
    can pop them or not (by touching them).
