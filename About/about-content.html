    <h1>About</h1>
    My name is Alan Koval. I am currently a senior at St. Charles East High School.
    <br>
    <br>
    I would say some inspiring story about how I rose from the most difficult of situations 
    to be a Nobel prize winning computer genius, but unfortunately that is false.
    <br>
    <br>
    What I can say is that I am a straight A student who enjoys tackling problems in 
    mathematics, physics and computer science.

    As for my resume, it pretty much boils down to the following (in order of goodness):
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href='http://alankoval.com/3dgrapher'>Koval's 3D Grapher</a>
            <br>
            This is my crowning achievement in terms of skills, mathematical prowess and 
            coolness. Like the title suggests, Koval's 3D Grapher is a fully HTML three dimensional 
            grapher. Unlike many (at the moment all) other similar graphers, this one is scalable to 
            your own computer abilities. It has correct rotation algorithms (yes, quaternions) and pretty 
            shading capabilities. It can graph in Cartesian, Cylindrical and Spherical coordinates 
            and even has point plotting capabilities. This combined with an exhaustive mathematical
            function library makes Koval's 3D Grapher the official coolest 3D grapher around.

            This was a project I undertook for my school's ping pong team as a sophomore. We had recently 
            graduated from a purely recreational group to a competitive team. It's the first website I made
            and actually doesn't look too bad. It houses an interesting rating system based on wins and losses
            which compiles automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stretchmaniac.adkalc&hl=en'>ADKalc Widget</a>
            <br>
            It may be useless, but it's nifty. Basically, it is an android app designed on request from my dad. It displays 
            data via a widget according to a formula. For example, you could specify "battery level:" battery_level and 
            the battery level would appear on a widget on the home screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.java.wallpapers.bouncingbubble&hl=en'>Bouncing Bubbles Live Wallpaper</a>
            <br>
            This one is another android app. It is a live wallpaper which features circles which bounce amongst themselves. 
            It does have pretty colors!
        </li>
    </ol>
    Otherwise, I would say that this blog is a pretty good indication of my skills in multiple areas.

    Wondering about the lizard in the footer? That's my mascot.
