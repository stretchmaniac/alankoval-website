		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Alan Koval. I am currently a freshmen at the University of Minnesota, studying computer science and mathematics.
			My goal over the next four years is to hone in on the sub-field that ideally captures my interest and talent while building
			a substantial base of practical industry skills.
		</p>

		<p>
			As an avid coder, I have had a number of projects over the years (enumerated <a href='alankoval.com/projects.html'>here</a>). 
			Many of them, including this website, are hosted on <a href='http://github.com/stretchmaniac'>GitHub</a> and freely available.
			Feel free to poke around: I dare say some stuff here is pretty cool.
		</p>
		<p>
			My interests tend to be scattered somewhere around the fields of computational geometry, genetic algorithms 
			and physical simulations. All my projects tend to be somewhat heavy in math (especially <a href='alankoval.com/3dgrapher'>
			Koval's 3D Grapher</a>), and I wouldn't have it any other way. Combining the mindset of mathematics with the power of 
			programming is my passion.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Otherwise, I'm a 13 year pianist, an intrepid biker (one has to be a little crazy to bike in the winter 
			here in Minnesota) and master ping pong player.
