        <h1>Dubins Corner Revisited</h1>
        <p>
            There is a subfield in robotics that concerns itself with so-called "non-holonomic motion planning."
            Motion planning is essentially the study of how to get robots from point A to point B in an environment, 
            with the "non-holonomic" descriptor targeting robots that have non-trivial motion rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you might wish for an RC car to correctly traverse a maze.
            A solution &mdash; that is, a set of movements for the RC car &mdash; must not only "solve" the maze 
            in the conventional sense, but do so in a way that respects the car's inability to move sideways (for example).
            An RC car is non-holonomic since its direction of movement is not completely free; it depends on what 
            direction the car is facing.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a further subfield of non-holonomic motion planning that restricts itself to the motion planning of an 
            idealized robot called the "Dubins Car". 
            Named after the mathematician Lester Dubins, this is a robot that traverses \(C^1\) (and almost-everywhere \(C^2\)) paths of the form
            \[ \left\{L(t):\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2:|L'(t)|=1\text{ and } |L''(t)|\leq 1 \right\}\,. \]
            This is a point robot constantly moving forward, having a minimum turning radius of 1. 
            Dubins' original 1957 paper detailed the optimal trajectory of such a robot to minimize the total distance traveled between 
            two "poses," an initial pose \( (p_i, \theta_i) \) and final pose \( (p_f, \theta_f) \), each 
            giving the position \(p \in\mathbb{R}^2\) and orientation \(\theta\in [0,2\pi)\) of the robot.
            Dubins' results can be (inexhaustibly) summarized:
            <ol>
                <li>The robot should either go straight or turn with radius 1 always. In other words, \( |L''(t)|\in \{0,1\} \).</li>
                <li>The optimal path between poses (with no external obstacles) consists of no more than three segments, with 
                    each segment either straight (S), a right turn (R), or a left turn (L).
                    It is common to refer to these paths by their constituent parts.
                    A "RSL" path, for example, consists of first a right turn (of minimal radius of course), followed by a straight 
                    section, and finally a left turn.
                </li>
                <li>Only paths of the form LRL, RLR, LSR, RSL, RSR and LSL can be optimal, up to degeneracy.</li>
            </ol>
            Since 1957, there has been a steady supply of new papers in the niche subfield.
            The typical paper that I have seen falls into the following categories:
            <ol>
                <li>Extensions of Dubins results. Some of these are the most well known, including the 
                    <a href='https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/1900/'>Dubins Airplane</a>, and
                    the <a href='https://msp.org/pjm/1990/145-2/p06.xhtml'>Reeds-Shepp Car</a>.
                    Other extensions allow a range of initial/final poses, for example.
                </li>
                <li>Different proofs of Dubins' original result. There are surprisingly many of these.</li>
                <li>Algorithms for approximating shortest paths in the presence of obstacles. This is by far 
                    the most popular, since it is most topical to the end goal of motion planners.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do I know (or care) about Dubins cars? Back at university, I joined the robotics lab 
            <a href='https://rsn.umn.edu/'>RSN</a> at UMN on a summer REU.
            Being somewhat uninterested in robotics, Dubins path planning was most palatable since I could study it
            almost exclusively as a math problem.
            Thus I spent the summer of 2018 developing what I can only describe as a particularly inelegant proof of the optimality 
            of a certain class of paths for a Dubins car turning a corner, as if in a hallway 
            (perhaps undeservedly accepted to ICRA 2019, free access <a href='https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/216038/19-005.pdf?sequence=1'>here</a>).
            Although much work has been done approximating optimal Dubins paths with obstacles, few papers have attempted to find explicit solutions 
            for prototypical examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            As evinced by the length and complexity of my paper, I concluded that such explicit solutions were, by and large, 
            difficult.
            However, lately I have come across a much simpler proof which I will show here.
        </p>
        <h2>The Dubins Corner Problem</h2>
        <p>
            <img src='dubins_corner/corner_diagram.png' style='width:50%; margin-left:auto;display:block;margin-right:auto;'>
            The problem is to find the shortest Dubins path from \(p_i\) to \(p_f\) around an interior corner 
            with angle \(\varphi\) (as in the above diagram).
            The solution in most cases is rather predictable, consisting of two three-segment Dubins paths joined at the inner corner.
            These paths are in the form RSRSR, RSRSL, LSRSR, and LSRSL, and may in general be parameterized by the angle made at 
            the inner corner.
            I've included a diagram below for a 90 degree corner, to show you how simple this is. (This is an RSRSR path).
            <img src='dubins_corner/corner_solution_1.png' style='width:30%; margin-left:auto;display:block;margin-right:auto;'>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that my paper also includes some "outer walls" of the hallway, among other features.
            I have found these to be primarily clutter that distracts from the main problem I wish to exhibit. 
            However, the outer walls do contribute to the solution in some cases and are of some interest. 
            Perhaps I will address them later.
        </p>
        <p>
            My paper made the following claim, slightly abridged for clarity: 
        </p>
        <p class='theorem'><span class='def-name'>(Alan's Theorem)</span>
            If there exists any RSRSR, RSRSL, LSRSR or LSRSL path from \(p_i\) to \(p_f\) with middle R segment passing through the inner corner, then 
            the optimal solution is either an elementary Dubins path from \(p_i\) to \(p_f\), OR an RSRSR, RSRSL, LSRSR or LSRSL path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here an "elementary Dubins path" is one of the three-segment paths originally formulated by Dubins to be optimal on the plane.
        </p>
        <h2>The New Proof</h2>
        <p>
            The main idea is that the class of optimal solutions {RSRSR, RSRSL, LSRSR, LSRSL} corresponds to
            a greedy-choice path planning through carefully chosen regions around the corner.
            The method is relatively simple: 
            <ol>
                <li>Choose four lines that partition the corner into five disjoint regions so that any path 
                    must traverse the regions in order (see diagram below). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find the minimal-length Dubins path between successive lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Show that the optimal RSRSR, RSRSL, LSRSR and LSRSL paths consist of the locally-shortest paths
                    constructed in (2).
                </li>
            </ol>
            The trick, of course, is to choose these regions to coincide with the Dubins path that we expect.
            <img src='dubins_corner/line_diagram.png' style='width:80%; margin-left:auto;display:block;margin-right:auto;'>
            The above image (credit to Geogebra for diagram creation) shows five regions within the available environment: blue, 
            yellow, purple, red and green. 
            Clearly, a Dubins path (blue line) must pass over the blue region before entering the yellow region, pass over the yellow 
            region before entering the purple region, pass over the purple region before entering the red region, and 
            finally pass over the red region before entering the green region, where it may terminate at the end pose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provided that the dotted lines are perpendicular to the Dubins path in question, it is certainly true that 
            the Dubins path contained in the blue region is the shortest Dubins path to start at the beginning pose and 
            reach the yellow region, as the Dubins path contained in the green region is the shortest to start 
            in the red region and reach the final pose. Likewise, the part of the Dubins path contained within the yellow region is a shortest Dubins path 
            which starts in the blue region and reaches the purple region, as is the Dubins path contained in the red region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our proof would be complete (at least for the RSRSR case, though RSRSL, LSRSR and LSRSL are basically identical) if we showed 
            that the Dubins path contained in the purple region, passing through the inner corner, is the shortest Dubins path from any point 
            in the yellow region to any point in the red region.
            Things get interesting here, because there are many different RSRSR paths passing through the inner corner, parameterized by 
            the center of the arc of the second right turn. The figure below shows three of these configurations.
        </p>
        <div style='display:flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-evenly;'>
            <img src='dubins_corner/corner_param1.png' style='width:31%;'>
            <img src='dubins_corner/corner_param2.png' style='width:31%;'>
            <img src='dubins_corner/corner_param3.png' style='width:31%;'>
        </div>
        <p>
            In the first and third images above, the blue path is clearly not the shortest between the yellow and red regions; a straight line 
            would do better. The second is more convincing, but we'll need justification.
