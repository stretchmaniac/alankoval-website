		<h1>Error Propagation Library</h1>
		<p>
			<a href='https://github.com/stretchmaniac/ErrorPropagation'>GitHub link</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			This python project implements arbitrary arithmetic on random variables numerically. As a short illustrative 
			example, suppose \(x\) and \(y\) are random variables representing the measurement of two tiles on the floor. 
			We sample \(x\) to be 30.1 cm and \(y\) to be 30.3 cm. Say we use a meter stick which gives some 
			error \(\sigma\) to both measurements. We can model \(x\) as a normal distribution with center at 30.1 and 
			standard deviation \(\sigma\) and \(y\) as a similar distribution centered at 30.3. Then 
			the random variable \(x+y\) gives the probability distribution for the actual combined length of the 
			two tiles. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This library allows arithmetic on arbitrary expressions.

			Koval's 3D Grapher is a WebGL accellerated function plotter in 3D. It has a few features:
			<ul>
				<li>Support for Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems</li>
				<li>Integrated parametric plotting</li>
				<li>Support for vector operations through the Math.js library</li>
				<li>Customizable plot quality, color, and transparency</li>
				<li>Intuitive mouse zoom and rotation mechanics</li>
			</ul>

			Ever wanted to try out your latest cellular automaton idea but don't want to spend the 
			time coding it? 
		</p>
		<p>
			If the answer is yes then you are a total nerd. Luckly so am I, and today's your lucky
			day. It's not blazing fast but it's a great tool for prototyping.
		</p>
		<p>
			For some quick eye-candy, click the options button (the gear) and scroll down to the examples 
			pop-down menu.

		<p>
			Brainfuck is what we call an esoteric programming language. It is aptly named. 
			You can get some quick (visible) output with the program <code>-[.-]</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can pause and step forward and backward while
			seeing your spot in the code in real time.
